This repository contains work done for a Research Intern position at Safran Landing Systems in Ajax, Ontario.
My particular contributions were towards the development of a software optimization tool, which will one day be used to help make the aircraft landing gear design process more efficient.
Due to the sensitive nature of the research project, only the final research paper (omitting SafranLS proprietary data) is included.
